The Recipe class contains properties for the number of ingredients and steps, as well as two lists to store the actual ingredients and steps. It also has methods to add ingredients and steps, display the recipe, scale the recipe by a given factor, reset the quantities of the ingredients, and clear the recipe.

The Ingredient class has properties for the name, quantity, unit, original quantity, and meal of an ingredient.

In the Main method, the user is prompted to enter the meal name, number of ingredients, names of the ingredients, quantities, and units of measurement. The user is then prompted to enter the number of steps and a description of each step. The recipe is then displayed, and the user is prompted to enter a scaling factor. If the factor is valid, the recipe is scaled by the given factor and the scaled recipe is displayed.

Overall, this code provides a simple way for the user to create and manipulate a recipe.
